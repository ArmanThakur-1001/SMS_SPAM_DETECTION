# SMS_SPAM_DETECTION
This project is aimed at building a machine-learning model for detecting spam SMS messages. The model is trained on a dataset containing labelled examples of spam and non-spam (ham) messages. The goal is to create a robust and accurate classifier that can be used to identify and filter out spam messages.
